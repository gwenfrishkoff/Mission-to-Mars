# Mission-to-Mars: A Web Scraping (MongoDB) project

## Project Overview
The target audience for this project is a free-lance astronomer, who wishes to scrape the web for images and metadata to perform exploratory analyses that can be used to create a job profile  

Use Web Scraping Tools to access images and metadata from the NASA Mars website,... 
Open the Window to the Internet (2 hours)
Automate a Web Browser and Perform a Web Scrape (3 hours)
Access Data in MongoDB (1 hour)
Display Data With Flask 

Use Beautiful Soup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape Create a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape
Create a web application with Flask to display the data from the web scrape
Create an HTML/CSS portfolio to showcase projects
Use Bootstrap components to polish and customize the portfolio

For the current project, we have been asked to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape the NASA Mars website for images and associated metadata, to store data on a Mongo database, to use a web application to display the data, and to alter the design of the website to display images. The client has requested three deliverables:
	<ol>
	<li> Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
	<li> Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
	<li> Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components.
	</ol>

## Data & Resources
For this project, we used the following resources:
	<ol>
	<li> MongoDB (v. 5.0.10) & Mongo Compass (for checking connectivity to MongoDB);
    <li> Flask, for creating web applications using Python;
	<li> Python 3, using Jupyter Notebooks web interface, together with the following methods and modules:
        <li> Pandas (to convert Python data to DataFrames);
        <li> Beautiful Soup (an HTML parser, for converting unstructured data from web pages to structured data for Python analysis); and
		<li> Splinter (an open source tool for testing web applications using Python & for automating browser actions).
	</ol>

## Results Summary
The python code that generates these deliverables is saved to the files 'Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb' (Deliverable #1), 'scraping.py' (Deliverable #2), and two supporting files: 'app.py' and 'index.html' (Deliverable #3).
